# Circular Video Recorder

Continuously record video in small clips.

Options:
- Clip count limit to avoid running out of storage space.
- Server to make the clips available for download on the local network. 

*Note: On Android, recordings are stored in `/Android/data/dev.imranr.circular_video_recorder/files`, which is accessible via the file manager but is not shown in gallery apps.*
